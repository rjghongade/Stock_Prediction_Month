# Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This Python script uses the Yahoo Financials API to retrieve historical stock price data for a given stock and then uses linear regression to predict stock prices for a specified number of Month into the future.
This Python script is designed to predict stock prices using linear regression. It fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and employs a simple linear regression model to make predictions for future stock prices. It serves as a basic example of how machine learning algorithms can be applied to financial data for predictive purposes.

1. Data Retrieval: The script uses the Yahoo Financials API to obtain historical stock price data for a given stock symbol.

2. Linear Regression: It applies a linear regression model to the historical data to predict future stock prices.

3. Customizable: Users can input their choice of stock symbol and configure the number of days into the future they want to predict.

4. Data Visualization: The script plots both predicted and actual stock prices, offering a visual comparison of the model's predictions with historical data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rjghongade/stock-prediction.git
   ```
   
When prompted, enter the stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.).

The script will fetch historical data, perform linear regression, and predict stock prices for the next day.

### Stock Price Prediction Project
This stock price prediction project is the result of collaborative efforts by a group of enthusiasts and learners. Our team, consisting of Ashwini Patil, Madhuri Phalke, and Rajendra Ghongade, embarked on this journey to explore the fascinating intersection of finance and machine learning. Together, we've created a Python script that leverages the power of linear regression to forecast stock prices. With data fetched from Yahoo Finance, our project offers a hands-on educational experience in stock market prediction, providing both a customizable and visually engaging tool. We're excited to share our work and encourage everyone to dive into the world of financial prediction. This project is a testament to our shared dedication and passion for learning and creating together.
